X-Plane Autopilot Interface

-- Features --

o Currently supports only Mac OS X (POSIX compliance will follow soon)
o Tested only with X-Plane 9.x, but should work with v8 too
o Provides optional HTML5 + Ajax gui (so far only monitoring)

-- Notes --

o only 32-bit mode, because X-Plane is compiled in 32bit
o 2.0.1 X-Plane SDK in SDK/ dir, feel free to customize

-- Installation --

 1) type make
 2) copy interface.xpl to Resources/plugins directory in X-Plane install dir
 3) optional: copy web/ directory to ~/Sites/ then have php enabled in apache and start apache
 (in this case fix paths in code, it's todo to make it dynamic)
